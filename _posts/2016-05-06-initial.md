I just created this new blog.

<strike>My previous blog can still be found at [blog.visucore.com](https://blog.visucore.com/).</strike> Possibly I'll port over the old posts at some point to make sure everything is in one place. There may even be some automatic way of doing this.

Thanks to Barry Clark's [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) for getting me started quickly with this format. It is a big leap from having to babysit a server, which has to run all kinds of software for creating dynamic content, and kept continuously up to date. Hosting static content is a breeze in comparison. Especially if github does it for me.

Also the integrity and authenticity of this site can be checked by verifying that the commits are signed by [my GPG key]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016-05-06-initial/laanwj.gpg). An advantage of [hosting this in git](https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2015/02/09/my-new-git-based-blog.html).
