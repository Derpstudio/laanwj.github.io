<intro>
<p>Recently I discovered the wonders of Doxygen (by ASML colleague Dimitri van Heesch). As that tool generates cross-reference links and even diagrams, it helps a lot in getting an overview of source code, quicker than browsing it in Github or in an IDE.</p>
</intro>
<p>I have generated and uploaded doxygen documentation for <a href="https://dev.visucore.com/bitcoin/doxygen/annotated.html">Bitcoin</a> and the
<a href="https://dev.visucore.com/doom3/doxygen/annotated.html">Doom 3</a> GPL source code that was released yesterday. Have fun browsing.</p>
<p>(the documentation will be automatically regenerated every day from the <code>master</code> branch)</p>
