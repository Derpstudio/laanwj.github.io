<intro><p>The <a href="http://www.usbee.com/sx.html">USBee SX</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_analyzer">Logic Analyzer</a>. However, from a low-level view it is simply a colorful high-bandwidth 8 bit I/O controller, of which the lines can be set to input and output individually (<a href="/2010/5/23/usbee-sx-external-pinout">external pinout</a>).</p>

<p>The advantage over (for example) a PC parallel port based solution is that the chip handles the capturing and sending of data with a certain sample rate. The operating system will never get in the way and mess up timings so that data is missed. Also, now that I think of it, none of my computers actually has a parallel port anymore.</p></intro>
<p>From <a href="http://www.sigrok.org/wiki/Logic_Analyzer_Comparison">what I read</a>, it is based on a <a href="http://www.cypress.com/">Cypress EZ-USB FX2 USB Microcontroller</a>. The firmware is not stored on the device, but uploaded after enumeration. The <a href="http://www.datasheetsite.com/datasheet/CY7C68013">data sheets</a> of the chip are public, the instruction set is based on the ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8051">8051</a>.</p>
<p>The API for the USBee SX firmware is not documented, although this <a href="/2010/5/22/usbee-zx-dll-routine-declarations">header file</a> (from USBeeZXApp) will probably help understanding the protocol when sniffing USB traffic.</p>
<p>I have looked with usbsnoop and it seems that the setup sequence is pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring 8051 in reset mode</li>
<li>Upload 4096 bytes of firmware at address 0 using control message 0xA0</li>
<li>Bring 8051 out of reset mode (jumps to address 0)</li>
<li>After this, the endpoints can be used to communicate with the device</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="/2010/5/27/usbee-sx-protocol-description">USBee SX protocol description</a> for an overview of the parts of the protocol I have decoded yet.</p>
