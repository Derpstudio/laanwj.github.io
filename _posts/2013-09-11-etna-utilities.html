<p>As you may have noticed I recently pushed a new directory <code>utils</code> to the <a href="https://www.github.com/laanwj/etna_viv">etna_viv source repository</a>. This directory contains various utilities related to the GPU and driver.</p>
<p>Some of these utilities are mostly useful for debugging the driver itself, others are also useful for optimization of applications using the driver. An overview follows.</p>

<h3>viv_gpu_top</h3>

<p>This utility provides a live view of the rate of change of the performance counters (profiling information). This is arguably the most useful of the bunch.</p>
<p>Here is an example while getting my ass kicked by the AIs in Quake 3 (update frequency: 1/s, action starts after some time due to loading delays):</p>

<p>The exact meanings of the various performance counters are not publicly documented AFAIK, although a lot can be guessed from the names alone.</p>

<h3>viv_info</h3>

<p><code>viv_info</code> shows the feature bits of all the cores of the GPU. These bits signify to the driver which rendering features are available. This is used to fill in <a href="https://dev.visucore.com/etna_viv/gpus_comparison.html">the feature matrix</a>.</p>
<p>Example output for GC860 (terminal can be scrolled with mouse wheel):</p>

<h3>viv_watch</h3>

<p>This utility shows a live view of all GPU debug registers.</p>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: Needs kernel driver compiled with user space register access (<code>gcdREGISTER_ACCESS_FROM_USER=1</code>). This is the case by default with most kernel drivers I've encountered in the wild.</p>

<p>Here is an example while bunny-hopping through <a href="http://quake.wikia.com/wiki/E1M1:_The_Slipgate_Complex">E1M1</a> of Quake 1 (update frequency: 1/s).</p>

<p>In general <code>viv_gpu_top</code> provides a more useful overview. However, the difference is that this tool shows all the debug registers, not just the performance counters returned from the kernel.</p>

<h3>viv_registers</h3>

<p><code>viv_registers</code> shows the current state of the GPU mmio registers.</p>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: Needs kernel driver compiled with user space register access (<code>gcdREGISTER_ACCESS_FROM_USER=1</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: this utility can result in crashes inside the kernel such as (on ARM),</p>

<pre>
Unhandled fault: external abort on non-linefetch (0x1028) at 0xfe641000
Internal error: : 1028 [#1] PREEMPT ARM
</pre>

<p>It appears that the actually accessible registers differ per SoC. When a non-accessible register is loaded, a fault happens. So expect crashes when using this utility.</p>

<p>Example (terminal can be scrolled using mouse wheel):</p>

<h3>viv_reset</h3>

<p>As you may have guessed from the name, this command resets the GPU. This should be useful if some erroneous input managed to hang it.</p>
<p>Note: this is known to be unreliable with many kernel drivers and can bring the GPU in a state that can only be recovered with a device reboot.</p>
<p>No screencast for this one as it has no output.</p>
