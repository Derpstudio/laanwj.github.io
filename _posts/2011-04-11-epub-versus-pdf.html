<intro>
<p>I finally discovered the advantages of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB" target="_blank">EPUB</a> format over PDF for eBooks:</p>
</intro>

<ul>
<li>The text is automatically reflowed to the size of the window</li>
<li>No concept of "pages" at all, the text in a chapter can be scrolled through continuously</li>
<li>The reader that I use (fbreader) appears faster on my laptop and uses less memory than PDF readers such as Okular or (horrors) Acroread</li>
<li>Files are small (&lt;500kB for an entire book)</li>
<li>Foreground / background colors can be configured, this is nice if you prefer reading on a dark background</li>
</ul>
<p>It's truly post-paper. PDF: The 15th century called and wants its fixed sized white pages back.</p>
<p>Recommendation: <a href="http://www.fbreader.org/">fbreader</a> is a nice program for reading epubs on Linux. It can be found in the Ubuntu package repository.</p>
