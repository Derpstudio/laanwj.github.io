<p>I've been using <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/duplicity/">Duplicity</a> for a while now to backup my Linux (virtual) servers. Duplicity is a bandwidth-efficient tool to do encrypted incremental remote backups via SSH, rsync, webdav and many others, for example <a href="http://www.brainonfire.net/blog/remote-encrypted-backup-duplicity-amazon-s3/">Amazon S3</a>.</p>

<p>My experience with the tool has been very good. Unlike a lot of incremental backup systems which work on the file level, duplicity goes a level deeper and only backups the blocks of files that have changed. This results in compact backups even with crazy database systems (like <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb.html">InnoDB</a> for MySQL) which put everything into one big file.</p>

<p>As the backup can run automatically from the crontab daily (or even more frequent if desired), it is an excellent no-hassle solution to have an extra level of safety for your files.</p>

<p>Amazon EC2 storage is pretty expensive, and if you only need secondary off-site backup, you can just as well use some cheap online backup hosting box such as <a href="http://www.datastorageunit.com/">Data Storage Unit</a>. This works fine for me. As your backups are encrypted and pass over the line (doubly) encrypted, it doesn't matter whether you trust the backup host at all.</p>
