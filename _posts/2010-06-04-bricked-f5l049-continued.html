<intro><p>I connected a <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/EvaluationKits/TTL-232R.htm">FTDI USB to TTL 3.3v</a> serial cable to the <a href="/2010/6/2/belkin-f5l049-board-pinouts">serial header on the device</a>, and managed to get into the bootloader by a magic trick (holding the reset button at power-on and immediately releasing it). Using minicom, I got a kind of debug shell...</p>

<p>Interesting! I've never heard of the CREAM/CAKE debugger before, and Google is no help either. This must be some proprietary Silex product. It at least has a HELP command. As far as I see there is no command to erase/change the flash though (read/write normal memory is possible); this probably has to be done through the network. Then again, together with JTAG the way to debugging the crashed firmware is open.</p>
